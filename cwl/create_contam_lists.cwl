  java.sh org.stjude.compbio.xenocp.CreateContamLists
    usage: java org.stjude.compbio.xenocp.CreateContamLists [OPTION] CONTAM_BAM1,...
                Looks for contamination in a sam/bam file by finding a
                better mapping in any of a list of contamination bams.
                The main output is a list of read names that are called as
                contamination.  You may also use -t to write records that
                were called as 'ties' to an output sam/bam file for
                review.
                This will operate on single- or paired-end data, but the
                input and contam bams must be 'logically' both single or
                or paired.  A read is considered 'logically' paired if it
                is actually paired or if it is single end but has a
                suffix of [non-alphanumeric char][12] that indicates
                read number in the pair.
                CAVEAT: All bams must have the NM tag, containing edit
                distance!
    -i <arg>   input file to use if not stdin
    -o <arg>   output contam reads file if not stdout
    -t <arg>   output sam/bam to which to write ties
    -V <arg>   validation stringency: STRICT, LENIENT, or SILENT (default: SILENT)
